                    <p>From the ripe young age of birth, Corbin Crockett has helped countless lost sheep find their way. As a black sheep himself, Corbin always strived to fit in with the crowd- often to no evail. His glorious
                        abilities made fools of the other children. He mocked them with his brain, willpower, might, and good looks. As he walked down the halls at school, the children we stunned to see a Greek god living among them.

                    <p>Growing up on the hard streets of Olathe, Kansas, Corbin pushed against all odds to find himself a better living environment. After being struck by a lightning bolt on a cold, winter's day, Corbin gained
                an IQ of 150. From then on, his brain buzzed at blazing speeds, allowing him to win a gold medal in every science fair he participated in.</p>

                    <p>As a naturally gifted kid with unspeakable talent, Corbin forced himself to harness his abilities and only turn them on when need be. His parents, both low-wage factory workers, infinitely admired his skill, and everyone
                    equally admired his swiftness in stress and alarm. The man, the myth- could not be stopped.</p>

                    <p>Although his abilities were admirable, Corbin suddenly found himself tumbling down a road of dispair as his girlfriend, ..., didn't exist. Without any romance, Corbin fell into the vicious cycle of jealousy
                    and, for the first time, admired his peers. Where he could not find happiness before, he could now. Booze and drugs filled his lonesome heart until it couldn't anymore, and then it bled into his other organs.
